&lt;h2 id=&#34;review-of-a-hardware-software-or-network-tool-in-the-training-company:34ebcfd1cfa3321b387d6c584f68cba4&#34;&gt;Review of a hardware, software or network tool in the training company&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this text I am going to review the QF-Test tool. This tool is used to test the functionality of an application. It’s especially popular among big companies, they use the tool to check if their software application is working like it’s supposed to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of those companies is SwissLife, they have been using the tool for four years now and they are very satisfied with it as they find the tool well structured and easy to use.
 I agree with Swisslife, because I think it’s a very useful tool. Unlike other test tools, QF-Test is very easy to upgrade to a better version. Another advantage of the tool is that all the different test suites are saved in small and structured files, which creates a clear view of all the work you have already done. The tool  can also collaborate with Java and HTML which are both part of the most commonly used programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the downsides are that the testcase files are not encrypted which causes them to occupy more memory. They purposely did this so that the files would be readable. In the two weeks of experience I had with the tool I came across a few bugs. Sometimes the tool can’t recognize certain elements of the application that is getting tested.
Another downside is that you can’t find much about the tool on the internet so if you get stuck on a problem it’s not that easy to find the answer. QFS, the company who owns QF-Test, found an answer to that problem and they put a tutorial online but I think this tutorial is not detailed enough and most of the time I had to keep trying new things until it finally worked. Finally it’s very important to check if  your application is able to interact with QF-Test because there are applications which can’t interact with QF-Test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I absolutely recommend the QF-Test tool to companies that want to make sure their software application is still working properly. You don’t need any education or training to  use it. You just need some programming knowledge and you’re good to go. There are more tools like QF-Test on the market. But what QF-Test distinguishes from the others is the well-structured graphical user interface and the efficiency to do a lot of things in a short time.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>IT autobiography</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Wout Segers and I am seventeen years old. I like to spend much time gaming. I am a first tier League of Legends player and I am also known to be a minecraft-god. Right now I am studying IT management at the Immaculata Institute. This is my last year of high school, last year I studied IT management as well. That was the first time I learned something new about IT. I had had some lessons IT at Sint-Jan but we only learned some basic things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I came in contact with IT was very long ago. I was at family reunion and my uncle had brought a laptop with him. I was five years old I think and at that time laptops where very rare I never saw something like that. He couldn’t do much with it but he showed me how he played chess with it and I thought it was amazing. When I was six years old , I got a Gameboy Advance for my birthday. My parents thought I would get addicted to it so they made a rule that I could only play one hour a day. Two years later I got my PlayStation Portable and then I really got into gaming. It was then that my father bought a new computer. I really enjoyed playing browser games on the “spele.nl” site. Now at this time I am really enjoying minecraft and League of Legends. Sometimes I am fed up with playing games and then I just go on YouTube and watch some videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT is a pretty big part of my life. When I come home from school I directly get on my pc. I don’t think I am addicted to the internet because I could easily live a week without the internet. When I go camping with the Chiro I don’t use my phone for ten days and I never had problems with it. I just got a new computer for gaming but also because I need it for school. I need my pc for almost every school task I make. I feel like how older I get the  more I rely on a pc and the internet. But I think that’s normal because a pc offers a way to do everything more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I pass this year I most likely am going to do something with IT. I am probably going to do something with programming because I like programming a bit more than network management. I think it’s a good idea to study IT because there is a lot of work to find in it. I would like to work for Blizzard or Riot Games because they are the producers of my favorite games and I would love to make those games even better than they are now already.&lt;/p&gt;
