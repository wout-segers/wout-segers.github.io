      <description>&lt;p&gt;My name is Wout Segers and I am seventeen years old. I like to spend much time gaming. I am a first tier League of Legends player and I am also known to be a minecraft-god. Right now I am studying IT management at the Immaculata Institute. This is my last year of high school, last year I studied IT management as well. That was the first time I learned something new about IT. I had had some lessons IT at Sint-Jan but we only learned some basic things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first time I came in contact with IT was very long ago. I was at family reunion and my uncle had brought a laptop with him. I was five years old I think and at that time laptops where very rare I never saw something like that. He couldn’t do much with it but he showed me how he played chess with it and I thought it was amazing. When I was six years old , I got a Gameboy Advance for my birthday. My parents thought I would get addicted to it so they made a rule that I could only play one hour a day. Two years later I got my PlayStation Portable and then I really got into gaming. It was then that my father bought a new computer. I really enjoyed playing browser games on the “spele.nl” site. Now at this time I am really enjoying minecraft and League of Legends. Sometimes I am fed up with playing games and then I just go on YouTube and watch some videos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IT is a pretty big part of my life. When I come home from school I directly get on my pc. I don’t think I am addicted to the internet because I could easily live a week without the internet. When I go camping with the Chiro I don’t use my phone for ten days and I never had problems with it. I just got a new computer for gaming but also because I need it for school. I need my pc for almost every school task I make. I feel like how older I get the  more I rely on a pc and the internet. But I think that’s normal because a pc offers a way to do everything more easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I pass this year I most likely am going to do something with IT. I am probably going to do something with programming because I like programming a bit more than network management. I think it’s a good idea to study IT because there is a lot of work to find in it. I would like to work for Blizzard or Riot Games because they are the producers of my favorite games and I would love to make those games even better than they are now already.&lt;/p&gt;
